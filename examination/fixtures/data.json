But the journalist started wondering about the other women who had trained alongside Ride in NASA’s first coed astronaut class. Those women — all formidable and accomplished in their own right — had also vied for a chance to be on that same historic shuttle flight. In Grush’s book, out Tuesday, Ride’s selection for the landmark voyage becomes a jumping-off point for an even deeper story about the US space agency’s first women astronauts, including what happened during their first flights, the pressures they faced on the job, and the barrage of sexist questions they fielded along the way.",
